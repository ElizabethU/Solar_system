    <p>What's happening in space is an interactive tool for learning about the solar system. On your screen are the planets along side white dots representing various spacecrafts. Though planets are exaggerated in size for visibility, everything is in it's real time position, updated daily with NASA telemetry. Press your arrow keys to spin the solar system around for a better 3D sense of where things are. Click on a planet or spacecraft to find out the latest discoveries.</p>

    <p>This app is dedicated to my dad, Sam Uselton, who passed away in April 2013, one year before this project was created. He would have loved to see me learning to program.</p>
    <p>One of the reasons I chose to learn programming was to feel closer to him. It seemed to me that the more I could see him in myself, the less of him would be totally lost to me. In the past year, I have seen my dad many places, but not always in myself. I have seen him in my instructors, my classmates, and the community at large, whenever someone has been brimming over with joy at sharing their knowledge with me, or figuring something out. I am immeasurably grateful to them for sharing that with me.</p>
